# wokwi-ci-action

GitHub action for using Wokwi Embedded Systems Simulator in your CI workflow.

## Usage

Add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Test with Wokwi
  uses: wokwi/wokwi-ci-action@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN }}
    path: / # directory with wokwi.toml, relative to repo's root
    timeout: 10000
    expect_text: 'Hello, world!'
    fail_text: 'Error'
    scenario: 'test-hello-world.yaml' # optional
    serial_log_file: 'log-hello-world.txt' # optional
```

You need to set the `WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN` secret in your repository settings. You can get the token from the [Wokwi CI Dashboard](https://wokwi.com/dashboard/ci).

Your repository needs to contain a `wokwi.toml` file that describes the simulation to run, and a `diagram.json` file that describes the components in the simulation and their connections. For more information, see the [project config documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/project-config).
